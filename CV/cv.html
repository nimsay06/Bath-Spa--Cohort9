 <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I began my coding
journey in late 2021 and
since have grown to love the
creativity that web development
allows me to explore. I was formerly
enrolled in university in the
humanities subjects, however after
some time I came to understand
that university was not the best place for me. After this, I stumbled across a video on web development and turned my 
complete focus into learning about
Front-end development, which has
lead me to this moment. I am
constantly learning new things about
web development and cannot wait
to fully master this craft.</p>

        <h2>Formal education</h2>
            <p>
            As being self-taught, I have had little experience in a formal setting, such as a University, when it comes to learning how to code. You can view my 
            formal education record
