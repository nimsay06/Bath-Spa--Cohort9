    <p>
      Your heart is racing<br />

      <i>*creak*</i><br />
      Another creak rings in your ears…<br />
      Your heart beats at a million mph as the steps come closer.<br />
      You cover your mouth trying to stop the sound of your panting from
      alerting whatever is making those footsteps.<br />
      And just then…<br />
      <br />
      The footsteps abruptly stop.<br />
      ...<br />
      Whatever is making that noise has stopped...<br />
      ... right at the entrance of the bedroom.<br />

      …<br />
      …<br />
      <i>*creak*</i><br />
      <img id="openDoor" src="images/opendoor.png" /><br />
      uh oh..<br />
