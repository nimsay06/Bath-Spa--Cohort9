      You make your way through the darkness of the living room to the kitchen.
      <br />
      After living in the house all your life you found it more than easy to
      make your way to the kitchen in the black of the night.
      <br />
      You open the drawer next to the sink and find the tealights.
      <br />
      You feel around the same drawer for the matchbox.
      <br />
      Once you find it,you strike the match and light the candle placed on the
      counter-top.
      <br />
      Finally, some light.
      <br />
      As you turn to exit the kitchen you notice a dark figure pass the window.
      <br />
      It must be the leaves blowing in the wind, you say to yourself.
      <br />
