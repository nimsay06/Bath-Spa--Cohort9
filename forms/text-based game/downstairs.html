    <p>
      Quicker than you have ever done, you speed down the stairs.<br />
      You decide to go back to the living room and hide.<br />
      But where do I hide?<br />
      You think to yourself.<br />
      The only place that you know for sure you can hide is underneath the
      table-cloth covered dinner table.<br />
      <i>*creak*</i><br />
      The noise is getting closer.<br />
      Another creak rings in your ears…<br />
      It is definitely footsteps.<br />
      Your heart beats at a million mph as the steps come closer.<br />
      You cover your mouth trying to stop the sound of your panting from
      alerting whatever is making those footsteps.<br />
      And just then…<br />
      <br />
      The footsteps stop abruptly at the entrance of the living room.<br />
