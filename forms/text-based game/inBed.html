    <p>
      You stay put trembling under the comfort of your bedding.<br />
      You start to count sheep to try and induce sleep but at the 66th sheep you
      knew it wasn't working.<br />
      Stuck underneath your blanket you question whether you should open the
      bedroom door… <br />
      Nope<br />
      You think to yourself.<br />
      And just then…<br />
      <i>*creak*</i><br />
      The noise is back and this time it is no longer slow heavy footsteps you
      hear, <br />
      rather they are skittish and rapidly gaining proximity to outside your
      bedroom.<br />
      <a href="stayHidden.html">Do you stay hidden in bed?</a> <br />
      OR<br />
      <a href="cupboard.html"> Find a new hiding place in your room?</a
