      You get yourself up from the carpet floor and walk towards the door of
      your basement.
      <br />
      The floorboards creek with every step taken, the noise of them jarring the
      constant rain hitting every window of the house.
      <br />
      You make your way down the basement stairs, its colder than usual.
      <br />
      To the right catch a glimpse of the breaker box as another strike of
      lightning hits.
      <br />
      You flick the main power switch but to no avail, the power is truly out
      and by the looks of things the whole street seems affected too.
      <br />
      You rummage around the boxes and find the emergency flashlight.
      <br />
      <i>*click*</i>
      <br />
      The flashlight switches on and your shine the light around the cold
      basement noticing that one of the windows that face street level is open.
      <br />
      Without thinking much about it, you shut it hard ensuring that the wind
      doesnt open it.
