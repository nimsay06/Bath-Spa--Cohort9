    You make your way to your bedroom.
    <br />
    As you reach the door you quickly run in and shut the door behind you.
    <br />
    The tapping noise from downstairs can no longer be heard.
    <br />
    Feeling tired, you get comfortable in your bed closing your eyes ready to
    wake up tomorrow morning to the bright sun and the noise of people leaving
    their homes to go to work, just like Mom and Dad.
    <br />
    Just as you drift off to sleep you hear something.
    <br />
    <i>*creak* </i>
    <br />
    What was that? you ask yourself.
    <br />
    You hear it again.
    <br />
    And again.
    <br />
    Is that footsteps you hear?
