    <p>
      The tapping noise continues.
      <br />
      It appears to be coming from the bathroom.
      <br />
      Your heart almost feels as if it is going to jump out of your chest as you
      tread slowly up the stairs towards the source of the noise.
      <br />
      <i>*TAP* *TAP* *TAP*</i>
      <br />
      It is definitely coming from the bathroom.
      <br />
      You hold in your breath as you stand outside the room.
      <br />
      Hastily you open the bathroom door.
      <br />
      With the help of your light source you scan the room.
      <br />
      ...nothing is there.
      <br />
      Then you notice the noise again radiating from the window.
      <br />
      
      Sighing in relief,you realise it was just a branch from the tree outside
      hitting the window as the wind surges.
      <br />
      You decide head back to the living room.
      <br />
      As you stroll back downstairs, you hear shuffling followed by the creak of
      floorboards behind you.
      <br />

      OR
