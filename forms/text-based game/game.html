      <p>
        It is a stormy night, thunder rolls as you sit in the living room in
        front of the glaring television half way through the new Half-Life game.
        <br />
        Lightning cracks and the tv turns from flashing lights to the reflection
        of yourself in the now dark room.
        <br />
        There's a blackout.
        <br />
