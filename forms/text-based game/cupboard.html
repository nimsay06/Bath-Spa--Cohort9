    <p>
      You leaped from the bed.<br />
      But where do I hide?<br />
      You think to yourself.<br />
      The only place that you know for sure you can hide is your wardrobe.<br />
      <i>*creak*</i><br />
      Another creak rings in your ears…<br />
      Your heart beats at a million mph as the steps come closer.<br />
      You cover your mouth trying to stop the sound of your panting from
      alerting whatever is making those footsteps.<br />
      And just then…<br />
      <br />
      The footsteps stop abruptly at the entrance of the bedroom.<br />

      …<br />
      …<br />
      <i>*creak*</i><br />
